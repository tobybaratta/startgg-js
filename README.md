# StartGG TypeScript SDK

This is a work in progress TypeScript SDK for Start.gg.

It is generated using graphql-code-generator and request-graphql.


## note

I accidentally committed on my old work account the first commit. So, you'll see a repository that is under `sre-is-toby` with the same code. It's..still me. shock!
